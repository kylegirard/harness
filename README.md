# Harness.js #
### The lightweight and intuitive boilerplate for Node.js you've always wanted. ###

Harness uses Mocha.js and BDD-style Should.js syntax to write easy
and intuitive tests for your Node projects.

With Harness, creating a new test is as easy as creating a new
.test.js file in the project folder.

Tests in Harness should sit in the same folder as the .js module
you're trying to test.

### Setup ###

1. ```git clone github.com:leisms/harness.git```
2. ```cd harness```
3. ```npm install```

### Running & Watching Tests ###
After creating your .test.js files, simply run: ```npm test```
